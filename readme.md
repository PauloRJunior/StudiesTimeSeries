# Studies Time Series

This project aims to study time series using various models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks such as LSTM.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, each dedicated to a specific model:

- `arima/` - Contains code and resources for ARIMA model.
- `sarima/` - Contains code and resources for SARIMA model.
- `garch/` - Contains code and resources for GARCH model.
- `linear_regression/` - Contains code and resources for Linear Regression model.
- `lstm/` - Contains code and resources for LSTM neural network model.

## Objectives

- To understand and implement various time series models.
- To compare the performance of different models on time series data.
- To gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudiesTimeSeries.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd StudiesTimeSeries
    ```
3. Explore the folders for each model to get started with the implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Refer to the README file in each model's folder for specific instructions on how to run the code and experiments.
